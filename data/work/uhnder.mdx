Uhnder was a startup focused on building imaging radars for ADAS and autonomy. Over my 3 years there, I contributed to sensor software development, hardware-software integration, and validation across multiple domains.

Key Projects:

1. Automated Sensor Testing and Software Validation Framework.

Contributed towards building an automation framework for sensor validation and testing across global labs, using Bitbucket Pipelines, Docker and Behave - a BDD framework for Python. Defined scenario-based test cases and implemented strategies to run experiments and analyze data, **improving operational efficiency by over 500%.** Built performance dashboards to provide deeper insights and accelerate decision-making. 

2. ROS

Developed ROS and ROS 2 based software packages for Uhnder sensors, including sensor drivers and packages for real-time data visualization and processing. Integrated new features (e.g., interference detection) into the radar software stack, conducted system-level tests, and ensured stable releases to customers.

3. Sensor Data Analysis

Led efforts to identify and resolve performance issues in radar data (e.g., blind spots, ghost detections). Conducted on-road and lab experiments, and developed custom Python/Matlab based tools for data analysis. Collaborated cross-functionally to prototype and test fixes.

4. Performance Optimization, Demos and Product Support

- Optimized radar scan designs to eliminate ghost artifacts and reduce false-positives.
- Deployed ML models on embedded platforms for real-time object detection, augmenting customer demos.
- Supported key customers on sensor integration, led technical workshops and product demos - **securing funding and investments for the company.**
